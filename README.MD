This simple note taking app allows users to create a note with a title, save it, view saved notes, and delete previous notes. It utilizes both Express and the UUID npm.

Front end code was provided by Northwestern's coding bootcamp and routes and ID creation were added to implement functioning note saving, population, and deletion. Melanie Uhrich provided assistance with the delete function.
